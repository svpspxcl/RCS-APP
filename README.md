This is a highschool Project. Using Python and its limited GUI options, I've made an app for my school. 
The User can see updates, events, tests, homework etc, which is taken from the txt files in this repository. Any teacher can use access the repository and add updates.
Cons:
Anybody can use this app, theres no logging in, making it insecure especially for a school app.
It's a windows app, deeming it useless in school as most don't use desktops, rather phones.
